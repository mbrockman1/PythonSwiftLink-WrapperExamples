# PythonSwiftLink-WrapperExamples

The goal is to rewrite plyer's iOS libraries to be compatible with PythonSwiftLink.

The reason behind this project is PythonSwiftLink is superior in performance and capability than pyobjus, given that you are writing native Swift. Documentation and examples are naturally more abundant with regards to Swift than pyobjus, so this will allow for more rapid development.
